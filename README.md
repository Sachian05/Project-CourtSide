# Project-CourtSide BETA
Q: What is CourtSide? 
A: Game statistics tracker. Track your goals, blocks, turnovers and more from basketball games with your friends to have a friendly competition.

Q: How Does CourtSide [BETA] Work?
A: Once I have setup all my friends profiles on the back-end, they will then be given their own login for the app and have access to the dashboard. Within this dashboard you have the ability to edit everyones stats, live. Who ever is sitting out will be the one with the role to update and track player stats.
